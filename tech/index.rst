Tech
============

Intro to tech
--------------------


Philosophy
----------

- We don't desire to build this all ourselves
- Architect smallest pieces possible, push down to lowest levels
- Standards come through use, collaborate with others

leverage as much as possible of others - freemarker, itext, etc.

Vision 
------
From any device be able to get vector and raster info for any area

- Browse all historical aerial imagery
- Search for all individual vector data points
- add any information, to an existing collab effort, or start your own
- go offline and pull data with out (ship out drive or sync when online)
- get updates in occasional connectivity

To get there
------------
- Open Aerial map (distributed)
- GeoNode collab
- Govs running, workflows to get data authoritative
- 

Support three main data types
-----------------------------
- Large raster
- Collaborative vector
- Real time vector

Spatialization of non-spatial data
----------------------------------
- Geocoder
- scanned map upload
- Joining against existing boundary data

Mobile
------
- Data gathering
- offline syncing
- versioning

Synchronization / versioning
----------------------------
- GeoSync
- WFS-V
- Conflict detection
- Distributed versioning
- Tile syncing
- REST API for feature editing (ESRI?  Google?) plus versioning
- offline
- ethermap

Federation
----------
vision for whole network, autoregistering, dns, central aggregators, portable ids, data syncing, etc.

Custom apps
-----------
- Framework for plugin development, sharing
- WPS solid, documented
- GeoScript
- Easy export/config of buttons

3d
--
- Javascript / html5 spinny globe
- 3d data in full pipeline

Cloud
-----
- Get suite working with spatial nosql db
- run completely in the cloud
- uploaders

Styling
-------
- complete, lay out roadmap
