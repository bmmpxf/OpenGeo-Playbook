Marketing
---------

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many organization have full departments devoted to their 'marketing strategy' and constantly refining their 'marketing plan'.  At OpenGeo we just don't have the resources to do extensive market, SWOT or customer analysis.  Nor do we plan to build up an extensive business team to be able to dominate a market.  Instead we focus on building the best software we possibly can, and put the vast majority of our resources there.  We view marketing as the way to educate people about the great software we're building, to get more people to check out what we're building and to join us.  A typical marketing plan ultimately focuses on profit - our goal is ultimately focused on creating amazing software.  So OpenGeo aims for simply enough revenue to keep making software, and hope to help build revenue streams for many others to be able to collaborate with us.  

To this end we do believe that marketing, broadly defined, is very important.  We do spend time on creating a strong brand, spreading the word about our software, making demos and writing papers to explain what we do.  But our primary driver in this is education, to make sure potential users and clients know what is possible with our software so they can decide for themselves.  We fully believe in the software we build, and we want more people to use it and help us make it even better.  But since proprietary vendors spend millions on advertising and marketing we must spend some time and energy to make sure our software gets out there.  This section will lay out the way we think about things that fall under a broadly defined category of 'marketing'.

Open Source
~~~~~~~~~~~

The center of our 'marketing' is the software itself.  We follow the path of successful open source companies like JBoss, SpringSource, RedHat, MySQL, Xen and more.  The basic strategy is make the best software possible, make it available to all as open source, and sell things that complement the software itself to a small percentage of people.  Since a good community is the key lifeblood of an open source project the strategy that has had the most success is to simply grow the number of users by making the best software.  So you never have to sell to the community, you sell to people who are used to buying proprietary software.  And they come to you because the software is simply better.  

Seen cynically the general open source strategy is just a variation on the `Freemium <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemium>`_ model, giving away a limited thing in order to sell a premium thing.  We tend to think of it as the opposite, selling a premium thing in order to give away as much as possible.  And we prefer to focus on 'premium' on things that actually demand our time, like support.  See our Open Core Approach (need to figure out how to link to it) for more on this thinking.  But the clear way that people find out about our software is because they can download it for free and try it out.  They come to us when they need additional help, and if they don't need anything at all then we're happy with that as well.  

The quality of our software has primarily spread through word of mouth, and these days most people investigating new software or a new standard will start with the open source version to be able to play around with no commitment.  So the fact that our software is open source is a key advantage, since we have to spend much less time 'selling' - the majority of our paying clients are already running it at least in testing environments and come to us to help them take it to the next level.  


Training and Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our main investments to promote our software are in documentation and training.  Open Source in general suffers from a (often correct) perception that it is not as well documented and is harder to get up to speed with, even though it is often more powerful.  We believe that making the software accessible is almost as important as the software itself.  Sometimes open source companies try to make documentation or training materials a revenue stream.  We view them as some of our best marketing materials, as they make our software accessible to more people, and are one of the first impressions the software makes.  We also invest heavily in great workshop material, which we deliver at many conferences.  We also make all of our training material available to everyone under a Creative Commons license, so that it can spread widely.  We do also sell training, and include training in our Enterprise packages, for those who want dedicated time from us to help them.  Our partners also can give trainings, translating it to other languages, and using it as a revenue stream or marketing.  We believe it is some of the best marketing, as everyone who uses the training materials walks away with more knowledge and tools to hopefully help them in their job.  The more people who use the software the higher chance there is that some of them will need further services from OpenGeo.

Messaging
~~~~~~~~~

Our messaging generally centers around a few themes:

* Technical flexibility, power and reliability, a concrete benefit of taking open source seriously.

* The guarantee of having a company filled with core developers standing behind the products and ensuring that clients are fully supported in all they do.

* A focus on solutions, created by working with existing systems.  We don't impose a new silo, but adapt to what technology is already in place.

* Freedom from vendor lock-in, as our architecture is firmly rooted in open standards, and with open source any other vendor can offer similar services.

* Web-based, more flexible, no per seat license fees, powerful, adaptable.


Our marketing plan - open source as vehicle to get product out there.  Then education around it, followed by conferences, papers, advertising.  Fundamentally we just want to teach people about our work, and some percentage of them will need support and buy from us.  

marketing message - solutions, not software.  A complete solution comes with the guarantee of support by the people who built all parts of the system.


positioning - web-based solutions geared towards domain.
