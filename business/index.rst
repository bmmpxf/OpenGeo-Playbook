Business
============

This section is a twist on a typical 'business plan', since our goals and structure are different than a typical business.  But we sustain ourselves through selling products and services in a competitive market, so many of the things we think about and plan for are more like a business than anything else.  Since one of our core tenants is openness we decided to write out all that is behind the face of OpenGeo.  Think of it as the 'source code' for our organization, where you can see the ways we think about things, our strategy, what we're planning to do next.  Our hope is that being upfront about all of this will enable us to more easily align incentives with potential collaborators.  And we welcome 'patches' on this plan, as we are constantly updating our thinking to adapt and respond to the changing world, looking to find a niche where we can support ourselves providing valued services while creating software that we give away to all.

Structure
---------

As our goal is to make open software for geospatial information we've decided to experiment with structures that prioritize that over making profit.  Whereas the goal of any publicly traded corporation is to 'maximize shareholder value' - make money - our goal is to 'maximize open source code'.  Corporations are now highly evolved animals, engineered to make money for all who hold an interest, with their products, ideas and services as the manifestation in the world that makes money possible.  Its instincts and motivations are to always seek out more growth to bring more shareholder value.  With OpenGeo we are seeking to engineer an animal whose instincts are to do whatever is best for the code.  Making money to support a team of developers is an effective way to further that, but the twist in motivations will likely mean that the most profitable route is not the one taken.

Of course we recognize that the world is not so black and white - corporations are filled with people who seek meaning, whose primary goal is to add great things to the world.  And this very often aligns with the goal of making money, indeed people who are doing their job because they believe in it do the best work.  But when their goals are at odds with those of the corporation then they are usually subverted by the structure.  The small twist with OpenGeo is we start with the premise of maximizing the mission, which lets us evaluate growth based on that - are we adding something useful, or are we just doing it to make more money?  We even realize that at some point the best thing for the code may be for OpenGeo to not exist.  If all users of the code naturally contribute according to their ability then there will be little reason for OpenGeo to exist - it could just be a loose collection of independent software developers who are funded cooperatively by everyone who benefits from their work and can afford to pay.  

OpenGeo's current structure is a division of a 501c3 non-profit called OpenPlans.  OpenGeo has received generous angel investment from OpenPlans and its primary benefactor, Mark Gorton.  But for the past few years the goal has been to become completely self-sustaining by competing in the market while simultaneously furthering the mission.  In the next year or two OpenGeo will likely start to make more revenue than its costs.  In a for profit structure this would go back to investors.  In the current structure this money gets returned to OpenPlans, to sustain its more charitable operations, or to help it start new ventures like OpenGeo that further its overall goals.  

At some point it may make sense to shift this structure, perhaps following Mozilla's model of spinning out a corporation that is owned by a foundation.  And/or becoming a B-corp.  We don't feel there is currently an ideal structure for what we are trying to do, and as the structure evolves we will always keep the goal of making open source software above that of making money.



Revenue 
-------

OpenGeo formed to bring about a transformation from a services company to a product company.  (should make a history section, somewhere else).  The ideal primary source of revenue is OpenGeo Suite Enterprise contracts, which at the core provide unlimited bug fixes and advice on stable software packages composed of the open source projects we support.  These are a great alignment of incentives, as clients desire software they can rely upon, without having to worry if anything goes on.  And with sufficient Enterprise contracts OpenGeo's incentive becomes to make the best bug free software, so that we don't have to spend our time fixing individual bugs.  In a open source project supported by consulting and services there is almost a perverse incentive to make slightly buggy software, so that ones services are always in demand.  With subscriptions at the core the incentive is to make the best software, get it as widely used as possible, and rely on organizations who would rather pay money to not have to worry and waste time.  The most successful open source companies have all relied on this strategy, so OpenGeo is just following in the footsteps of Red Hat, Spring Source, Xen, JBoss, MySQL and more.  

OpenGeo's focus on geospatial software is more niche, but our revenue desires aren't nearly so ambitious.  The reason for shifting to a product company is to have more control over the roadmap, and to be able to take risks to incubate new projects and products.  With just doing services the roadmap is completely dictated by the clients.  And it is very hard to get clients to fund much of the unglamorous work of Open Source, like community management, releases, and bug fixes.  With support revenue this becomes something required by clients.  

We will never entirely give up on services, and indeed in the transition to a full product company services are required.  In the long term we hope to push most of the implementation and training work to our partners, with OpenGeo focusing on core software development, documentation, training material production, and bug fixing.  In the short term there is not enough of an ecosystem that has the skills to do truly great implementations, so we continue to do services.  Some developers will always do services, because it is really useful to stay in touch with how people are actually using the product.  A number of the services OpenGeo currently does is also things that are directly on the core roadmap already.  So service work will also be used as a type of funded research and development (R&D).  OpenGeo will likely never have a huge R&D budget, but instead will rely on clients to fund things that are of future interest, since we look for market feedback in all we do.  These clients will be more early adopter types, who can see what's coming next, and we may prototype some pieces to point the way forward.  But we'll always do services for core development of our roadmap.

In time partners will also be resellers and provide first line support.  But a percentage will always go back to the core, for the core software development and for the OpenGeo brand.  OpenGeo will always provide the solid, reliable brand around the open source software, and will continue to invest in marketing and press to keep it strong.  


Many faces
----------

One of OpenGeo's core value propositions is that we ease the interface between traditional organizations and open source communities.  We willingly adopt several different faces, so that people and organizations can interact with us in the way they feel comfortable.  While open source communities are making some of the best software in the world today it can be quite difficult for an organization that is used to purchasing software from proprietary companies to interact.  This makes sense, as the primary mode of interaction in a community is as individuals.  A company looking to buy software from an open source community is like showing up at a potluck thinking it's a restaurant - both parties will just be very confused.  Complaining about shoddy service won't go over too well, and if you try to pay the potluck participants will tell you to go to go home and make something, or at least buy something at a store and bring it.  

You can think of OpenGeo as a little stand set up by potluckers right outside of the potluck.  If you want to just eat all the great food at the potluck they'll take your money, set your table, dress up as waiters, bus boys and hosts, and serve you course after course.  Behind the scenes they'll cook some more for the potluck so there's enough for all to eat.  They can also dispense with the table service, but still contribute to the potluck on your behalf, so that everyone else is psyched that you came and sat at the table.  Or they'll just help you cook your own dish, giving you advice on where to place it, how the line works, when to get seconds, where to place your dirty dishes, and when it's your turn to help out with the cleaning.  If you already know how it all works, but just don't have the time to cook they'll make your dish for you.  And they're always excited for people who show up and already know how potlucks work, since it just leads to more awesome courses for everyone (including the people who want to go to the restaurant).

The equivalents of these modes of interaction are mirrored in how OpenGeo actually works.  

 * The most public face of OpenGeo is the full service one.  Organizations can interact with OpenGeo just like they do with proprietary software companies.  There is a professional website, prompt response to inquiries, items to buy, salespeople to help you through the process, legal contracts holding the company accountable for anything going wrong, support staff, training, stable release schedule, consultants to customize the software, local partners and extensive documentation.  The software also is easy to purchase, as OpenGeo is on a variety of contract vehicles, like the GSA and several state specific ones, and is also able to sell through partners in other countries.

 * OpenGeo can be funded to directly develop features that go in to the open source codebase.  Instead of having to hire one's own developers OpenGeo can be contracted to deliver an enhancement, going through the whole community process to ensure that it gets in to the Open Source baseline.  Since our developers work with the code and community every day they can usually deliver much faster than anyone else.  

 * Those who want to get involved with the community can use OpenGeo to help introduce them.  OpenGeo can consult on how to join, how to write code that will get accepted by the community process, what good contributions might be, etc.  OpenGeo can mentor and train people to become core open source contributors, if that's important for their organization.

 * Many people who are already great community members often use OpenGeo for help on its core areas of expertise.  Many of them already contribute to the software, code or documentation and help on lists.  But to meet their clients or needs they will leverage OpenGeo as an extra cook in their kitchen to ensure that the result is of the highest quality.

 * OpenGeo is on the lists every week, encouraging more contributors, helping with review of patches, doing releases, and in general helping build and expand great communities.  All the work funded by clients goes right back in to these communities, and OpenGeo does its best to be seen as a great contributor.  But at this level it's really about individual contributors, people who work for OpenGeo and are able to contribute the work done while paid by OpenGeo clients to all.


So the primary reason for OpenGeo's current public existence is really to provide a face to risk averse organizations to have the same experience they do with proprietary software.  To help those who want to tap in to the amazing results of open source software, but need a well known way to interact.  

Our long term dream would be for the need for that alternate face to drop away.  The ideal would be that every organization contributes up front, each according to their ability.  Open Source software is really a cooperative, and if there were a direct mechanism for passionate developers to always get paid for useful software then there'd be no need for marketing and sales and branding.  But this is obviously far from the world we live in.  And we accept that the vast majority of users never contribute anything.  Thankfully the costs are relatively low, and there are organizations who have real needs that involve contracting OpenGeo and its core developers in some way.  

So in the long term OpenGeo's public face could drop away, though it'd likely still exist as a cooperative to help contract developers.  But in the meantime OpenGeo provides a sort of asynchronous cooperative - the organizations who contract OpenGeo are pooling their money at the time that's convenient to them, for a result that all benefit from.  To compete effectively in the market it's quite important to have all the trappings of a proprietary company, so OpenGeo will continue to invest in marketing, sales, contract vehicles and a great reputation that can be relied upon.  And meanwhile we strive to be the best community members we can, even if that could enable a company that puts OpenGeo out of business - for it to succeed in the long term it must continue to make the software better, which is our long term goal anyways.


Product focus
-------------

The focus of OpenGeo's product is to make it as easy as possibly for people to share and collaborate geospatially.  We see 'product' as a layer of value on top of our individual open source projects.  The product is more than just software, it includes all the pieces around it that turn it from a bunch of 1's and 0's in to something that solves a problem.  OpenGeo currently only has one product - the OpenGeo Suite Enterprise Edition.  

OpenGeo's goal for each open source project is to make it as flexible and powerful as possible.  The point of the Suite is to make that power and flexibility available to a much wider audience.  It adds installers that bundle all the needed dependencies and extra options, pulls the documentation together in one place, and adds a recipe book to help educate.  It also includes several end user applications based on GeoExt, including GeoExplorer, Styler and GeoEditor.  These are examples of what can be done, and also provide immediate out of the box functionality.  The Suite comes already optimized and integrated, but is also distributed as individual components that can be easily adapted for existing environments.  The Enterprise Edition includes unlimited bug fixes and advice, and future versions will come with a few more extras.  All but the Basic level also include training, as well as discounts on consulting work.

The general future product focus is to be the best platform for building geospatial applications.  It should be as easy as possible to get set up, include the best support on the market, and provide the most flexible tools to easily build anything that leverages geospatial information.   It should naturally educate users to be able to go from no knowledge to making powerful applications (we've still got quite a ways to go on this last one).  

It should also be a platform that enables partners and clients to build their own products.  This includes not just the software, but being able to offer unlimited support on products built on the OpenGeo Suite.  This will be accomplished with business relationships that bundle the Enterprise Edition support and extras with products built on top of it.  


Our Open-Core approach
----------------------
There is much written about the Open-Core model [#f1]_.  There has been backlash against it, as some companies using the term lack a real commitment to open source.  Since OpenGeo's reason for existence is to further the open source software we naturally put making software ahead of huge revenue to make investors happy.  But we draw inspiration from good Open-Core companies.  The essence is 'give me a cookie' [#f2]_ - include _something_ in the Enterprise package that you can't get in the normal package that you can sell a CTO/CIO on.  

At OpenGeo we discussed internally at length if we felt ok about having code that we didn't release as open source.  Everyone agreed that it's worth it if a very small piece of proprietary code can help make a business model that funds us to spend the vast majority of our time on open source code.  But we want to do that as little as possible, and that we prefer not having to do anything proprietary.  

The first year of the OpenGeo Suite had a Community Edition and Enterprise Edition with the exact same code base.  The Enterprise Edition did get additional testing and QA, but had no extra code.  It included unlimited support, access to more granular upgrade packages, and larger levels bundled in training.  We sold a number of them, but not enough to avoid tweaking the model.  For the 2.4 release we likely will have two 'extras' in the Enterprise Edition.  The first is bundling `GeoCat Bridge <http://www.geocat.net/bridge>`_ software, which is a plugin to ArcGIS Desktop tools to publish to the OpenGeo Suite.  The second is extra monitoring functionality.  The base monitoring API is a community module in GeoServer, but we include additional GUI tools in the admin panel that build on top of it.  Our philosophy on choosing these is that are quite far from the core.  The first is only useful to ArcGIS desktop users (which generally are not the same people standing up the server software and building applications), and the second is mostly useful to systems administrators.  We follow Matt Asay's advice [#f3]_, which is to sell to IT Operations - who will spend money to save time.  

So we are now experimenting with making a few pieces more private.  One thing we may try in the future is keeping things private for an explicit amount of time, and then releasing as open source.  We've considered that for things like WMS 1.3, which everyone wanted but no one would step up and fund (big props to the UK Ordnance Survey for finally doing that).  It's not something we could in good conscious keep out of the open source core, but keeping it private for a time could provide a way to spread the funding for it to paying Enterprise clients.  We also favor extras that aren't code.  One leading idea is a subscription service to OpenStreetMap updates, where we automatically keep a database and custom tiles in sync.  Enterprise clients would get updates, everyone else would just have tools to get it once and do updates on their own.  Other ideas include nicer automatic upgrades and networked monitoring tools.  


Next Product Steps
------------------

As we expand our revenue from Enterprise contracts we will be able to have more a more concrete roadmap for each OpenGeo Suite release and our future products.  In the short term, however, the roadmap is a complex interchange of open source contributions, funded client work, dedicated product time, and aligning customer needs with our roadmap.  But we have little doubt that we will make progress on the following major areas in the next year.

Cloud
~~~~~

Cloud aligns with our goal to make it as easy as possible to add geospatial capabilities to web applications.  Though we've made great progress in easing the installation of the OpenGeo Suite it still requires hardware and a systems administrator, as well as know how on optimizing and scaling it.  Our goal with the cloud is to completely abstract the whole problem of running the infrastructure.  

The OpenGeo Suite already has cloud options, with our partners at Skygone, and as AMI's on Amazon.  Though these match the offerings of our competitors on the cloud we plan to go much further.  The main piece we want to tackle is auto-scaling, firing up new instances on demand.  This is the true advantage of the cloud, to be able to handle any load.  We see interesting use cases like massive tile generation, firing up 100+ machines to cut the process from weeks to hours.  

Our goal is to be able to offer instance hour pricing for fully supported software, that includes automatic upgrades, security fixes, monitoring and scaling.  It should also be very easy to deploy applications developed elsewhere on to the cloud, with test and development instances before going to production.  We like the cloud a lot as a product direction, since it provides extra value to clients.  The combination of supported open source software and cloud computing will allow us to offer incredible capabilities in one package at a great price.

Easy Custom Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Though the projects we work on provide an extreme amount of flexibility there is still a hole in easily composing them in to applications.  A decent developer has no problem, but our goal is to make it easier for technically inclined users to make custom applications.  The center of this is our GeoExplorer application and the GXP framework.  Past advanced Editing and Styling this year we will start to incorporate geospatial processing.  The standards-based Web Processing Service (WPS) is now a part of GeoServer.  We hope to advance `GeoScript <http://www.geoscript.org>`_ and build up easy ways to compose custom processes and incorporate them in to GXP-based applications.  Also needed is some more 'wizard' type functionality to easily compose applications through the GUI itself.  

We believe that advances in this will open up the power of geospatial to a much wider audience.  People who are technically inclined and understand maps, but who haven't had GIS training.  Instead of a model of training them in desktop tools when they will likely do the same 5 operations again and again we hope to make it easier to just design and build a geospatial powered application that speaks in the language of their domain.  

Data gathering and collaboration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our mission driven goal is to move beyond just sharing data, to helping enable people to build and maintain geospatial information.  We will build upon the existing editing capabilities, pushing further in the direction of versioning and geosynchronization, to enable robust infrastructures for editing.  We also seek to advance 'official' workflows in conjunction with crowdsourcing initiatives, to help risk averse organizations be able to leverage the power of the crowd yet also maintain their required quality.  We see initiatives like OpenStreetMap as a great step in the right direction, but want to enable that type of collaboration for smaller communities on all types of datasets, not just street maps.  The core software should be flexible for lots of different workflows, licensing schemes, and communities.  It should offer a step forward for all geospatial collaboration, and be compatible with existing tools while also pushing the edge on html5 compliant approaches.  

Mobile
~~~~~~

Key to data collaboration and custom apps will be mobile capabilities.  We've prototyped several applications, and plan to push things much further as mobile platforms are clearly the future.  We hope to enable not just the viewing of geospatial information but mobile editing, for applications like asset management, surveys, and reporting.  Our initial approach will be to push our existing javascript tools as far as possible, leveraging mobile web-browsers, but also wrapping them in toolkits to make them more compatible with mobile environments.  This allows us to share and reuse much more code.  

Quality
-------

Key to OpenGeo's success is a relentless focus on quality.  Instead of chasing competitors, attempting to implement more features that we can market and sell, we work towards an ideal version of our software.  A system so flexible, user friendly, and powerful that it is the natural choice for anything geospatial related.  We've still got a long ways to go, but right now we believe we have a foundation that is more solid than anything else out there.  As we grow we will dedicate developers to just continually refining and improving that foundation.  

Our costs are often high due to our focus on quality.  We rarely take any shortcuts when developing - we make sure that code is pushed to the lowest library level and written in the most flexible way.  The only time we will code things in a less than ideal way is to prototype a concept, to make a demo of what is possible, and then we come back and build it right when we have a chance.  We also employ a full time interaction designer, to ensure our user experience isn't just an afterthought.  

This focus on quality is essential to our success, since the premium that top quality affords allows us to put appropriate time in to building great open source software.  The first thing that is most always cut in companies working around open source is contributions to the baseline, so we'd have to do the same if we were working in a cut rate manner.  Our clients know that we will always deliver high quality code faster than anyone else, so they continue to work with us.  They know that their system will be one that is supported by a wide open source community, not some custom thing that only their paid consultants will understand.  

The business model for Enterprise contracts depends on having the highest quality product.  The path that all open source companies have followed to success is to have technology that blows away the competition.  This is relatively easy because open source is a superior development methodology.  But it must be higher quality at every level, to achieve ubiquity.  Once ubiquity is achieved you can count on a small percentage of organizations being risk averse and valuing their time very highly.  It is thus a no brainer for them to pay the experts to support their system.  But the key to getting there is to get the software used everywhere, and the only way to do that is to build the best software possible.  


Build a network
---------------




Partners
---------

* Implementation work
* contract vehicles
* Translation
* Customization
* Productization
* Leverage network to spread products
- Make core stronger

Niches to help build core
--------------------------

- transportation
- asset tracking
- logistics
- risk modeling

OEM pricing, back to communities
--------------------------------

Cloud services
---------------

tech strategy - align with other open efforts, and other efforts in general, find key we can add.  GS tech story, with freemarker, pdf thing, etc.  Bends back on community.  Some of this is tech, but here do the biz angle.  Maybe belongs in partners?  Unofficial partners?

Needed Network
---------------------------

Other needed collaborations for open geo web, things OpenGeo likely won't do, but want to encourage

- open source cloud (open stack)
- generic api key control
- openid/oauth
- gov transparency apps (open source socrata)
- mozilla, html5, web
- Foundation to support Open Data

Structure Notes
---------------


OpenGeo Core

Ideal structure of OpenGeo 50 people, $10 million in revenue, starting new initiatives, incubating new opengeos, core software improvement, making money for partners, funding others for core development.

-> different because we employ people, from apache/osgeo.


Biz Team

5 Sales managers - US, South America, Europe, Mid-East/Africa, Asia/Pacific
 - Each mostly manages partners, builds networks, sets strategy
3 marketing - build brand, run events, write whitepapers do PR, marketing automation, advertising. Plus they have a big budget to outsource
2 biz dev, strategy, partner program



Outreach Team

5 on training / education - continually refining and adding material, making webinars, doing online trainings, and training trainers - so partners can run lots of trainings around the world.  Also reaching out to college courses and helping develop longer form course material.

2 on full time documentation, core open source docs, reference materials, interactive docs / recipes, new examples, tutorials.

5-8 Flex expert implementors / demo creators / partner trainers.  Team will be able to go out and make new cool geo apps.  Should be pros, able to take on any project, but team should always be taking on 'interns', getting more people as experts.  These guys should serve as second line support, always know the answer.  If they are between paid projects then they do pro bono mapping activities.  They also do all the support calls, so must have slack to handle that.

Core Devs - main responsibility is making beautiful code.  Are not very product driven, but take lots of input from product teams.  But also respond a lot to community needs, ensure great architecture and help plan for roadmaps from product teams.  Main goal is to always sure speed, scalability and flexibility in the core

2 Java (geoserver/gwc/geotools/jts)
1 C    (PostGIS, GEOS, gdal?)
3 Javascript (OpenLayers, GeoExt)
1 Python (GeoNode)

2-3 product teams of 3-6 each.  Suite and GeoNode.  Could be a cloud product, could be a new thing we incubate, could be a mobile thing.  If successful it may spin out, but leave 1-2 core devs behind at opengeo.  Each will have a a product manager, at least a couple devs, and balance of needed designers / web devs / etc.  Will contribute substantially to core code bases, putting down at lower levels whenever possible.  And can also leverage the core devs, count on deliverables from them, etc.  Each product will have clients, who fund it, whether by direct project work or by buying the final product.  Also 1-2 QA / testing people who are shared between product teams (and core devs can leverage them)

Designers - should have at least 2-3 dedicated designers.  Interaction, graphic, web, etc.  There may be dedicated ones on products, but also a pool setting the brand and image of OpenGeo as a whole.  Everything should look tight and have real interaction depth.  They will do continual user testing and refinement, work closely with each product, but also set deadlines across all.  Look to reuse metaphors and code.

Ops - 1 Sys admin, 1 accountant, 1 HR
